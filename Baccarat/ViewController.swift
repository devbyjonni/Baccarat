 Eight decks of cards are used.
 
 Cards are given point values as follows: Ace = 1, 2-9 = pip value, 10 and face cards = 0.
 
 At the start of a new shoe, the dealer will turn over one card. This will determine how many cards the dealer will burn, according to the baccarat value, except a 10 or face card will result in 10 cards burned.
 
 When the cut card appears, the dealer will finish that hand, play one more hand, and then start a new shoe. If the cut card comes out instead of the first card, the dealer will finish that hand, and then start a new shoe.
 
 Play begins by all players betting either on the "player", "banker", or a tie. Players may also bet various side bets.
 
 After all bets are down, the dealer gives two cards each to the player and the banker. The score of the hand is the right digit of the total of the cards. For example, if the two cards were an 8 and 7, then the total would be 15 and the score would be a 5. The scores will always range from 0 to 9 and it is impossible to bust.
 
 A third card may or may not be dealt to either the player or the dealer depending on the following rules:
 
 If either the player or the banker has a total of an 8 or a 9 they both stand. This rule overrides all other rules.
 If the player's total is 5 or less, then the player hits, otherwise the player stands.
 If the player stands, then the banker hits on a total of 5 or less. If the player does hit then use the chart below to determine if the banker hits (H) or stands (S): */
